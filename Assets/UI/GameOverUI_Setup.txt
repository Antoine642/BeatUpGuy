Game Over UI Setup Instructions:

1. Create a Canvas object in your scene (if one doesn't exist already)
   - Right-click in Hierarchy > UI > Canvas
   - Make sure the Canvas has a Canvas Scaler component set to "Scale with Screen Size"

2. Create a Timer Display:
   - Create a UI Text (TextMeshPro) object as a child of the Canvas
   - Position it at the top of the screen
   - Name it "TimerText"
   - Add the Timer script to the Canvas object and assign this text element to the timeText field

3. Create a Game Over Panel:
   - Create a Panel object as a child of the Canvas
   - Name it "GameOverPanel"
   - Set its anchor to stretch in both directions (fill screen)
   - Add a Background Image component with semi-transparent dark color
   - This panel will be hidden by default and shown only on game over

4. Add UI elements to the Game Over Panel:
   - Create a TextMeshPro Text object as child of GameOverPanel
   - Name it "GameOverText"
   - Set text to "GAME OVER"
   - Position it at the top of the panel
   - Style with large, bold font

   - Create another TextMeshPro Text object as child of GameOverPanel
   - Name it "CompletionTimeText" 
   - Set text to "Your Time: 00:00:00"
   - Position it below the Game Over text

   - Create a Button object as child of GameOverPanel
   - Name it "RetryButton"
   - Set text to "Retry"
   - Position it below the completion time text

   - Create another Button object as child of GameOverPanel
   - Name it "MainMenuButton"
   - Set text to "Main Menu"
   - Position it below the retry button

5. Add the GameOverUI script to the Canvas:
   - Assign the GameOverPanel to the gameOverPanel field
   - Assign the CompletionTimeText to the completionTimeText field
   - Assign the RetryButton to the retryButton field
   - Assign the MainMenuButton to the mainMenuButton field

6. Create and Link the GameManager:
   - Create an empty GameObject in your scene and name it "GameManager"
   - Add a GameManager script to it (you may need to create this script)
   - In the GameManager script, add a public field: public GameOverUI gameOverUI;
   - Assign the GameOverUI component from your Canvas to this field via the Inspector
   - The GameManager should include methods like GameOver() and CompleteLevel() that will control the game state

7. Final Steps:
   - Make sure the GameOverPanel is set to inactive (unchecked) by default
   - Test the game by triggering the GameManager.GameOver() or GameManager.CompleteLevel() methods
