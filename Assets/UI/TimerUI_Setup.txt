Timer UI Setup Instructions:

1. Create a Canvas object in your scene (if one doesn't exist already)
   - Right-click in Hierarchy > UI > Canvas
   - Make sure the Canvas has a Canvas Scaler component set to "Scale with Screen Size"

2. Create a Timer Display Panel:
   - Create a Panel object as a child of the Canvas
   - Name it "TimerPanel"
   - Set its anchor to top-right
   - Size it appropriately (e.g., 200x50 pixels)
   - Add a Background Image component with semi-transparent color
   - Set its position to be visible at the top-right corner of the screen

3. Add Timer Text:
   - Create a TextMeshPro Text object as a child of TimerPanel
   - Name it "TimerText"
   - Set its text to "00:00:00"
   - Center it within the TimerPanel
   - Style with an appropriate font and size
   - Make sure it's clearly visible against the game background

4. Add the Timer Script:
   - Add the Timer script to the Canvas object
   - Assign the TimerText object to the timeText field in the Timer script
   - Ensure the script is properly configured with default values

5. Test the Timer:
   - Play the game to ensure the timer starts running automatically
   - Check that the timer displays correctly and updates in real-time
   - Verify that the time format is displaying minutes:seconds:milliseconds
